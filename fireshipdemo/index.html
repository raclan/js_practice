        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Yesterday I worked on getting the HLCS stats done in Python. It took some time, but I was able to do it within the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was actually a lot easier than I thought, though I did have to look some things up to remind myself on how to use Pandas. I was able to transfer the work to the Google Sheets pretty easily.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I haven't really been going to the gym as much as I should have. I did go yesterday for push day, and tomorrow is pull day.

        <h3>ASA</h3>
        <p>
          I wonder how this weekend will turn out. I wonder how this week has been so far for the club. I hope it's all good things.
        </p>
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>
          I need to start swimming again, with or without people. I know Chris said he would join me though, so I wonder if anyone else will.
        </p>
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>
          I'm not sure what I'll do after this. I'll probably use these skills for something fun for HLCS, or I'll make an actually useful website for the journal entry data.
